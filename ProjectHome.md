YAPGVB provides Python bindings to Graphviz, with an intuitive Python interface.

# Where to get Yapgvb for... #

## ... Linux ##

  * Ubuntu and Debian: _sudo apt-get install python-yapgvb_

  * Others: Download the [source tarball](http://code.google.com/p/yapgvb/downloads/list?can=2&q=source&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount) and see README

## ... Windows ##

  * [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/yapgvb/downloads/list)

  * [Deprecated](http://code.google.com/p/yapgvb/downloads/list?can=4&q=&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount) versions for Python 2.4 and 2.5 are more powerful, since they use the Boost.Python bindings.

## ... Mac ##

  * (Untested) Download the [source tarball](http://yapgvb.googlecode.com/files/yapgvb-1.2.0-source.tar.gz) and run _python setup.py install_

# Reference #

  * [Documentation](http://yapgvb.sourceforge.net/doc/) is still on Sourceforge for the moment

  * [Examples](http://code.google.com/p/yapgvb/source/browse/#svn/trunk/yapgvb/examples%3Fstate%3Dclosed) are in the source code repository.

# News #
  * 1-31-09  Hosting moved from Sourceforge to Google Code

YAPGVB 1.2.0 will work on Windows with recent versions of Python.

A pure-Python backend has been created, so YAPGVB is no longer dependent linking to Graphviz libraries.
